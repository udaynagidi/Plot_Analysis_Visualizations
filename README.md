# 📊 Plot Analysis & Visualizations – Python Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis (EDA) through rich visualizations can uncover trends, distributions, and relationships in structured datasets. The project leverages Python libraries such as *pandas, **matplotlib, and **seaborn* to build impactful visuals for data storytelling.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
This notebook uses a structured dataset loaded from CSV format (or simulated data) containing attributes like:
- Categorical and numerical features
- Time-based values (optional)
- Segments, regions, or product categories

> (If this was based on a specific dataset, add it here with the source link)

## 📈 Visualizations Used
- *Histogram* – Distribution of numeric data
- *Box Plot* – Outlier and spread detection
- *Bar Plot* – Category-wise comparisons
- *Line Plot* – Trends over time or sequence
- *Scatter Plot* – Bivariate relationships
- *Heatmap* – Correlation or density matrices
- *Pairplot* – Combined view of all relationships

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Visuals revealed skewed distributions in numeric features
- Strong correlation between feature A and target variable
- Certain categories dominate the dataset disproportionately
- Some plots helped identify outliers or erroneous data entries

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone Plot_Analysis_&_Visualizations.ipynb

## Tools: Jupyter Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Inspiration: Project-based learning in data storytelling with Python

---
This notebook is meant to help students, analysts, and data enthusiasts improve their visualization storytelling using Python.
